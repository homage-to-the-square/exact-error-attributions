Here, I breifly describe how the effective sample sizes are generated file-wise.
- The notebooks are numbered per-step, with the second notebook being the most critical: sampling from the finite population for a given sample size, and then saving the results. 
- Every time a simulation is run, the simulation results are saved in either sim_results or srs_sim_results, split per iterationn (and also potentially sample size).
